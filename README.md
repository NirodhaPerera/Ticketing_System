Ticketing_System_CW
This is a terminal-based Java project that demonstrates the Producer-Consumer pattern using multithreading with the Runnable interface.

ðŸ§µ How It Works
Vendors act as producers, releasing tickets.

Customers act as consumers, purchasing tickets.

Threads are created by implementing the Runnable interface.

Proper synchronization is used to handle concurrent access and ensure thread-safe operations.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This project was built to understand and practice core Java multithreading concepts, especially the Producer-Consumer model using the Runnable interface.
